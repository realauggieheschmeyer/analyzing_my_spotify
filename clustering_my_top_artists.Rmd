I recently discovered the [`spotifyr`](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/) package that allows you to access the Spotify API data within R. More importantly, it allows you the opportunity to download and analyze your own listening data. As a data nerd and an avid Spotify user, I thought it would make a fun exercise to see if there are any patterns within the music I listen to and if I can back up my self-described musical tastes ("alternative rock with a pop bent") with data.

In this post I'll take a look at my top artists and their genres tro see how similar they are. In my next post, I will look at my top songs or, as Spotify calls them, *tracks*.

### Setting Up the API
